## 🧠 About Me

I am a **junior Python developer** currently learning **Git, GitHub, and DevOps**.  
I am starting to work on my **first CI/CD pipeline** and building a solid foundation in software development.

So far, I have experience with:
- Writing and understanding Python code (around 1400+ lines)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Data structures: lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples
- Control flow: conditionals and functions
- Modules, imports, and packages
- Basic usage of NumPy and Pandas

This repository reflects my progress, practice, and continuous learning.
